Queen Mary of Romania&#039;s coach. Peasants wearing local costumes came from all the corners of the realm. The end. A great tragedian, Sarah Bernhardt. At 12 years old, Sarah Bernhardt is already grave and mystical. She obtains the first prize of tragedy in 1861. In 1868, she is a pensioner of the Odeon theatre. In 1872, she enters once again at the Comedie-Francaise where she had only stayed a couple of months. In 1884, she creates &quot;La Dame aux Camellias&quot;. She triumphs in the Tosca that was performed in the theatre &#039;La Porte Saint-Martin&#039;. She acts in plays by Jean Richepin. Then in 1891, she creates &quot;Theodora&quot; of Sardou. From 1893 to 1898 she lead the Renaissance theatre. There, she enacts Phaedra of Racine. &quot;La Princesse Lointaine&quot; (the far away princess) of Edmond Rostand. The Municipal Council in 1899, gives her a theatre that bears her name. This is where she creates &quot;L&#039;aiglon&quot;. &quot;Les Bouffons&quot; (the fools). Her tours in America were a big success. In Belle-Ile-en-Mer where she spent her holidays, she loved relaxing on the rocks of the wild coast. In her domain of Fort-des-Poulains, she received her friends. Here she is with Mrs. Charlotte Lyses. During the war in 1916, she shoots a film of Jean Richepin &quot;Meres Francaises&quot; (French mothers). (Eclipse editions). Here she is, coming out of the town Hall where she was just a witness for the wedding of Yvonne Printemps and Sacha Guitry. In 1921, she receives in her Belle-Ile property the stage director and the artists of the movie &quot;Les Trois Mousquetaires&quot; (the three musketeers). Her death was a huge consternation. Her funeral procession crosses all of Paris between a hedge of mourning spectators. ...and stops in front of the theatre she so skillfully managed. The young girls of the Art&#039;s orphanage accompanied her procession. Through the popular neighborhoods of the suburb of Saint-Antoine and the Roquette, the procession arrives at the cemetery of the Pere-Lachaise. The end. The students of the Naval school organized a triumphal evocation of the French marine throughout the years. Wearing the costumes of old marines, the students reconstituted all of the old fleet. Here is the galley with its rowers chained to their benches, under the guard of the overseer. From the marine of the antique caravel to the modern iron clad one, the motto stayed the same &quot;Honor and homeland. The end. Number 2. French Railway and Customs workers in the Ruhr (sequel). The train service is facilitated by our Railway soldiers. At the closure station of Halthausen, our customs workers watch over the fraudsters. Travelers, car drivers, all must stop to have their luggage inspected by the customs workers. In Dusseldorf, the general Degoutte and the general of Rucroy inspect the troops aligned in front of the Hindenburg avenue. The general Degoutte presents the honor legion to the officers of the Belgian Chiefs of Staff who participated in the occupation of the Ruhr. Views from the Essen factories. Border of the occupation zone. The end. Funeral of two Frenchmen assassinated in the Ruhr. Buer. Huge funerals have been organized for the Lieutenant Colpin and Mr. Joly.
